## cryptopals

This repo includes my work on the first sets of the [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) challenges. It also includes a tool I threw together to help with an unrelated crypto problem.

I originally started solving the challenges in go. I'm now learning rust, and thought it'd be helpful to run through the challenges in that language - both to expand my knowledge of rust and to refresh my memory on everything cryptopals covers.
